## Migrate from another Plugin

If you have been using the other inventories plugin, and want to switch to use Multiverse Inventories, we support the following:
- PerWorldInventory
- WorldInventories
- MultiInv

`/mvinv migrate <plugin>`

## Import vanilla Player Data
Vanilla player data are stored in the world folder's `playerdata` folder. If you have imported an existing world from another server or single player and want to Multiverse-Inventories, you will need to run a special import command.

`/mvinv playerdata import <worldname>`
